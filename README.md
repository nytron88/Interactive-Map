# Interactive-Map

Use 'npm start' in the map folder to start the front-end reactjs part of the app. This will display the map.
In the pyweb server, run the main.py python file in order to start the Flask server.

Now when you click on any of the states in the front-end reactjs part of the app, it will pull data about the state you clicked from the server and display it on the right side.
